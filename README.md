### Pn_excerpts contains selected code from a project I did for an NYC startup.

The solution, written from scratch, pulled data from a pair of web APIs and stored it in a PostgreSQL db, 
whose schema I designed and implemented. Emails could be sent via MailChimp to addresses culled
from the db.

The full project comprised 2000 lines of Python source, plus 1000 lines of docstrings and 100 comment
lines. Blank lines are not included in this tally.

##### Technologies: 

Python 3, PostgreSQL, JSON, MailChimp, Git, python-mailchimp3 (an API client).
